OVERVIEW: 
This directory contains folders and files used for manual segmentation of imaging data into individual cell soma. 


REQUIREMENTS:
1) The image processing program Fiji, available at https://fiji.sc/


INSTRUCTIONS:
To manually draw ROIs:
1) Open the motion-corrected multi-page TIFF in ImageJ or Fiji.
2) Subtract the mean image from the multi-page TIFF. This will make it easier to visualize changes in pixel value relative to baseline. 
3) Open Analze>Tools>ROI Manager...
4) Scroll through the mean-subtracted mutli-page TIFF one frame at a time. This will make fewer potential soma visible at any given time and aid in segmentation.  
5) While scrolling through the multi-page TIFF, use the 'Freehand Selections' tool to inscribe a region of interest (ROI) around each putative cell soma. 
6) After inscribing each putative cell soma, press 'Add' in ROI Manager.
7) After inscribing ROIs around all putative cell soma, navigate to More>>Save... in ROI manager and save the ROIs as manualSeg.zip. 

To view ROIs drawn in previous segmentation sessions:
1) Open the motion-corrected multi-page TIFF in ImageJ or Fiji.
2) Open Analyze>Tools>ROI Manager...
3) In ROI Manager, go to More>>Open... and select the .zip file containing the ROIs created for that movie. 


METADATA:
The metadata files associated with output from this pipeline should have the following format:

segmentation_metadata = 
{'inputs':{'motion-corrected TIFF':'path\to\motion\corrected\tiff'},
 'outputs': {'ROI coordinates (.zip)':'path\to\manualSeg.zip'},
 'dependencies': [path\to\Fiji (version)],
 'parameters': {}
